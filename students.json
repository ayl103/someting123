      "description": ["Anthropocene is a geological epoch of human as the primary impact of Earth's environment and climate change. Anthropocene starts since the Industrialization revolution period where it shapes our modern lifestyle on relying on the non-renewable resources. While we enjoy owning the earth's resources, wildlife animals are forced to interact product technology and adapt to environmental changes generated by the human.","Coexist is an interactive installation exhibition space provided for the user to play the short game POLAR. The space of the installation depicts human technology evolve from civilization. From a green land converted into a building cement and now becomes a small space for my setup. Furthermore, Polar is a one-person game that is displayed on a large monitor screen and requires an area in front of it for a player to play the game and a crowd to watch the screen. The crowd represents the by-standing effect as a metaphoric representation of human watching events happening without acting.","The Arctic is the symbols of purity and wonder, but it is also well-known as the icon of climate change. I went to Alaska to fulfill my dream, and I brought back a unique experience on investigating human-wildlife coexistence. In the Anthropocene era, technology is the primary negative impact that causes environmental destruction. However, it is also the tool for the human to proceed forward. Coexist explores the possibilities of emerging technology in creating a good social impact in environmental issues.","Polar is an animal-centered experimental game created for Coexist that attempts to formulate player's empathy with animals by shifting their role from a human to other living species in the same space. Polar, the game, focuses on portraying wildlife animals’ vulnerability to live in Anthropocene era. The user plays through the eye of Polar Bear to experience their struggle for survival on their habitat. Are you ready to be a POLAR BEAR and survive this winter? Think like a Polar Bear!","Can you win the game? Yes, the answer is in your action." ,"How to win the game? To win the game, you need to understand how wildlife can adopt new environmental changes caused by human activities.","Human activities bring direct and indirect destruction in the Arctic. Climate change increases the sea level strongly affect the wildlife that is highly dependent on sea ice. The melting sea ice forced Polar Bears to migrate south. But there is a new challenge that is facing them – direct contact with human causes human-wildlife conflict that threatens both lives." ,"This project is the starting point of investigation on possible solutions to improve human-wildlife coexistence. The goal of the project is to influence users to think sustainable by planting a seed in their head through a short experience or story."],

      "description": ["Walking Through The Darkness is a large scale projection that takes the viewer into a world of those living without light and reveals stories hidden in the darkness. Inspiration for this project came from Jeana's experience as a videographer for a short documentary she directed about a group of Parsons lighting design students visiting Puerto Rico four months after Hurricane Maria destroyed the main power grid of the island. While documenting communities still living without electricity, she was inspired by the resilience of the Puerto Rico communities and their adaption to their new rhythm of life living without electricity. Each night as dusk would approach, a quiet stillness would fall over the neighborhoods without electricity. As the team would make their way back to San Juan each night where electricity was working, they would see pockets of light that would appear and disappear within various neighborhoods.", "There was a moment when we were driving through a community just after dusk and we could hear the generators kicking in for the night. As I had my camera out the window trying to film, I turned to my right in the opposite direction and could see a globe of light floating in the middle of the doorway of a unlit home. As we drove passed, I realized it was a person standing there, a woman figure in the darkness with a solar lamp light around their neck, just quietly standing there watching our car lights pass by. The visual was so powerful. It finally hit me how many other lives are in the dark around us and throughout the island, quietly waiting. We forget about the life living in the dark because there is such a disconnect with light and darkness. We think life is only in the light, but there is life breathing in the dark as well. These communities are slowly being forgotten about and to this day still don't have power. She's still standing there night after night watching the world pass by and what are we going to do about it?", "Jeana's memories of the quietness and pockets of light discovered from the experience guided her to recreate a 3D environment within Unity to capture the visuals that she was unable to capture with digital film. Each vignette of light is inspired from real life interviews and visuals she witness while visiting the communities of Puerto Rico."],

      "description": ["Target and Control is a video installation that creatively reimagines the story of the coconut moth (Levuana iridescens) and the campaign that was carried out against it in colonial Fiji. Due to its rapid proliferation and destruction of coconut plantations in the early 1900s, a campaign of biological control was carried out against Levuana by the British Imperial Bureau of Entomology, resulting in its near-complete disappearance in a span of six months and, ultimately, a declaration of its extinction.","Using the original scientific illustrations from the Levuana Campaign, the artist superimposes herself in the role of the entomologist, bringing the drawings to life in order to perform a set of arcane scientific experiments, ranging from benign to gruesome. The hands of the artist can be seen selecting, measuring, dissecting, and rearranging the moth and other experimental organisms like puzzle pieces or interchangeable mechanical parts. By performing these gestures of scientific control, the artist questions the role the entomologists played in the moth’s annihilation, as well as the ethical implications of attempts by humans to control or “redesign” living systems.", "Projecting the videos onto a light table, Target and Control asks viewers to mimic the scientific gaze, as though looking through a microscope or at specimens on a lab bench. By watching the performance video, the viewer is invited to re-witness the control and demise of Levuana and consider the loss of the individual moths, as well as the singular loss of the species as a whole."],

A pot holder and a pot will be assembled as an entity that children use to grow and verbally interact with vegetables. Furthermore, a guidebook is particularly designed for parents to enhance coaching and supervising the interaction between children and the vegetable character in the pot. My aim is children’s personal and emotional connections with produce through the interactions presented: by listening to vegetable’s growth stories, questioning, and caring them. "],

Each prompt would help people to quickly get into the writing mode and plan their tomorrow or reflect on their day. After writing, users will be able to see seven others' writings following the same prompt they wrote. Also, if users like specific responses, they can subscribe to that user. By reading others’ perspectives on life, people can feel sympathy, get energized, and have new insights. Whenever people complete seven prompts, the application will create a collection of seven prompts at a time, so people can reread and look back on their past again. This system will remind people of their thoughts and encourage them to make changes in their lives. For the long-term goal, the users will build a writing routine for themselves as well as make changes in their lives based on their writings about their life plans and goals."],

      "description": ["With the rise of biotechnologies and the availability of genome sequencing, the growth of DNA databases could become a looming problem. The Unclear Evils of DNA is a design fiction that speculates on the practice of widespread genetic collection and modification in the near future. There is growing awareness of the importance of protecting our online data, however this campaign for sovereignty must extend to our biometric data. My aim is to raise critical discussion of biotech advancements, particularly on how we need to be wary of genetic collection and human modification.","Set in the year 2035, the fiction proposes a future where the government has declared a mandate to collect the populations genetic information. The story follows the life of a scientist who is studying genetic modification on non-viable human embryos through studying people’s genetic information from the database. She later discovers her facility has already begun testing protocols on viable embryos and questions the ethicality of proceeding in unchartered experimentation."],

There is a word at where the user starts his/her journey. And at the same time, there are associated words around the start word. The ones which share more common are more closely placed. User can keep picking words and get dynamic associated words with his/her movement. Generated contents will appear sentence by sentence. If user wants the content to be more dramatic, then he/she picks a word that is far away. Imagination becomes bigger when the word has less relationship to the first word. Also the shape becomes more dramatic."],
